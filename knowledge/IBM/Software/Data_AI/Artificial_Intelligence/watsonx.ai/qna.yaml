      - question: |
          Who is watsonx.ai intended for?
        answer: |
          watsonx.ai is designed for data scientists, ML engineers, and business analysts through both code-first and no-code interfaces.
  - context: |
      IBM watsonx.ai is a next-generation enterprise studio designed to help organizations train, validate, tune, and deploy both traditional machine learning (ML) 
      and generative AI models. It is one of the three core components of the IBM watsonx platform, alongside watsonx.data and watsonx.governance.
      The platform offers an intuitive, open interface supporting both code-first and no-code users, and integrates a library of foundation models (FMs), 
      including IBM Granite models and open-source LLMs such as Llama and Mistral. These models are pre-trained on diverse, high-quality enterprise data 
      and are optimized for tasks like code generation (fm.code), natural language processing (fm.NLP), and geospatial analysis (fm.geospatial).
      watsonx.ai helps organizations accelerate AI development by simplifying the AI lifecycleâ€”from data preparation and model training to deployment and monitoring. 
      It enables enterprises to operationalize trusted AI by leveraging secure, governed data, and provides tools for prompt tuning, fine-tuning, and prompt engineering.
      As part of a broader AI and data platform, watsonx.ai integrates seamlessly with watsonx.data (a data lakehouse for governed AI workloads) and watsonx.governance 
      (for managing model risk and compliance), supporting real-time collaboration across data science teams and enabling scalable, responsible AI for enterprise use cases.
